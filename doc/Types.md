| bool  | logical type that can have only true or false
| boolLike  | types convertable to boolean: number and bool
| array | sequence of elements with index access
| arrayLike | object that has indexed access to elements and length property
| object    | data sctructure of key:value pairs
| map   | object with key access to values, but without Object's function
| objectLike  |
| mapLike   | object or map
| RegExp    | regular expression for matching text
| Range | array-like object with two values : indecies of first and last + 1 element

| Buffer | container for dealing with raw data
| Raw Buffer | fixed-length raw binary data buffer - ArrayBuffer
| Typed Buffer | array-like object of single type that provides a mechanism for accessing raw buffer, for example : Uint8Array,Float32Array,Int32Array etc.
| Node Buffer | alternative for Typed buffer optimized and suitable for Node.js
| Routine | independent part of code wrapped into function
| Error | runtime exceptions defined by a user
| Consequence | advanced synchronization mechanism based on resources and competitors
| Consequence argument | resolved value, any type except undefined
| Consequence error | rejected value, error object or any type except undefined
